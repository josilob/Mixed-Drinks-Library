## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP

- API Fetch
- Render components
- Routing between components
- Responsiveness
- Netlify deployment

#### PostMVP

- CSS/Design touchup
- Additional form to search by name
- Animations / Transitions
- New libraries and frameworks utilization
- Images

## Components

##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.

| Component |                                      Description                                      |
| --------- | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| App       |                  This will be top element with routing functionality                  |
| Header    |                    This will render the header and include the nav                    |
| Routes    | This will route center part of the page between components (drinks/about/cocktail...) |
| Footer    |                  This will render the footer and social media icons                   |

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.
